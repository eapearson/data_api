.. note::

    These scripts require a valid KBase authentication token to be in the
    environment at runtime. Unfortunately, there is no really easy way to get
    this token right now. Below are two possible approaches.
    
    1. From the UI. Login to KBase, open a narrative
    (any narrative), and then use the developer tools for your browser to get to
    a JavaScript console and then print the value of the variable ``kb.token``.
    Once you have this value, set it in your environment as KB_AUTH_TOKEN,
    e.g., in the Unix bash shell, e.g.: ``export KB_AUTH_TOKEN='un=myname|tokenid=...'``.
    You can add this command to your login scripts (e.g. your "~/.bash_profile")
    so it's not so painful in the future.

    2. Another approach is to use the ``kbase-login`` command, run inside a KBase environment.
    From the command-line, run ``kbase-login`` to retrieve a token and check your ``.kbase_config``.
